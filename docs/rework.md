# Launcher rework

The playbook for building the new launcher UI on a real TV. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) first, then this,
then the spec, [design_preview/README.md](../design_preview/README.md). Everything mocked or deferred is in
[BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md).

| Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| How a screen behaves: flows, Back, focus, what OK does | The prototype in [`design_preview/`](../design_preview/) and its README |
| How it looks: spacing, sizes, colours | Figma (file `7gFFvfdGdXJVLZnj18Zah4`, read-only through the Figma MCP server) |
| What was decided and how we work | This file |
| What is not real yet | [BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md) |

## Roles

- **Project lead** (the repo owner): decides scope and open questions, merges every PR, and says when the real
  TV is free.
- **Lead engineer** (a coding agent): plans each milestone and builds the foundation. Hands work to sub-agents,
  reviews what they produce, and checks it on the emulator before it goes to the project lead.
- **Sub-agents** take a milestone or part of one, with this file and the spec as context. Their work reaches
  the project lead only after the lead engineer has reviewed it.

If something isn't answered here, in the spec or in AGENTS.md, ask the project lead; don't assume. When a
question is settled, add it to [Decisions](#decisions).

## Decisions

Settled with the project lead on 2026-10-28.

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| The old launcher | Replaced outright, in M1: the new activity becomes Home, and the old Home UI and its feature code are deleted, along with tests that only covered them. |
| TV plumbing kept | Home and Input key accessibility helpers (`HomeKeyService`, `InputKeyService`), `SystemSettings` with the vendor fallback, the Inputs rules of `MainActivity.showInputs()`, the remote-key handling, the Home guard in the scripts. |
| Carried into V1 | The hold-OK tile menu (Move, Remove, App info), restyled. |
| Left for V2 | Themes and wallpapers, the clock screensaver, module cards and add-ons, Watch Next, festivals, sky and lunar calendars. Listed in [BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md). |
| Toolkit | Plain Java and Android Views, with the existing Gradle build. No Kotlin, no Compose. |
| Typeface | Roboto, the system font; nothing bundled. Sizes and weights follow Figma, which uses Inter. |
| APK size | The 512 KB gate is not enforced in this fork. Each PR reports the size; M0 changes `ci.yml` to report it instead of failing. |
| Languages | English only. Launcher translations, RTL and the translated READMEs are dropped. |
| Catalogue | Mock in V1, ported from `design_preview/src/data`, behind an interface a TMDB source can replace. |
| Availability and prices | Mock in V1. |
| Watch on … | Opens the service's app. Opening the title itself is in the backlog. |
| Watchlists | My list, Seen, Favorites, recent searches and recently viewed are stored on the TV. Household and Friends are mock placeholders; they will come from the project lead's TMDB lists (backlog). |
| Services ("Included") | Worked out from the installed apps, with a `config.xml` override. A settings screen is in the backlog. |
| Region | SE. Searching SE and US together, with each result labelled, is in the backlog. |
| Weather | Real, from Open-Meteo (no key), at a latitude and longitude set at build time. |
| Clock and units | Follow the TV's settings: 12 or 24 hour, °C or °F. |
| `addons/household-search/` | Removed; it was an earlier attempt at search, replaced by this rework. |
| Secrets | The TMDB key, latitude and longitude go in a gitignored properties file read at build time, never in git. |
| Home app row | The household's ordered favourites (by default the installed streaming apps), reordered with hold-OK Move. |
| Wi-Fi dropdown | The header (network, internet, signal) is real. Saved and other networks open Wi-Fi settings, as the spec allows. |
| Test devices | An Android TV 9 (API 28) emulator at 1920×1080, then the project lead's TCL BeyondTV (Android TV 9). |
| Toolchain | Installed system-wide: JDK 17 with winget, the Android SDK in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`. |
| Branches | One feature branch per milestone, one PR into `main`; the project lead merges. |
| Check-ins | After every milestone: emulator screenshots and a short summary, approved before the next starts. |
| Staging the deletion | Split (decided 2026-10-28). M1 deletes the old Home's code, its translations and RTL layouts, and the tests that covered only those. M1b prunes `Config.java` and `config.xml`, the theme-visual tools and tests, the docs and the README's old launcher sections. Until then `Config` keeps every key, with its pure helpers (`Festival`, `RaceWeekend`, `Sun`, the `Wallpaper*` classes) dormant. |
| `themes/` and `addons/` | Kept in the repo, unused by the new launcher, until V2. The `config.json` push (`tools/theme.sh`, `ThemeProvider`) stays: `examples/*/config.json` carries per-TV plumbing keys through it. |
| Launcher settings | The old `LauncherSettingsActivity` stays, without its grid, dock and wallpaper rows, until the new page is designed. |
| Pull requests | Every PR asks the Copilot reviewer for a review. |
| Settings key over apps | `QuickSettingsActivity` draws the same dropdown as Home (`MenuPanel`), so the remote's Settings key looks the same everywhere. |

## Open questions

Raise these when they become relevant; don't settle them alone.

- The name and location of the gitignored properties file (decided in M2 or M3, when the first value is read).

## Milestones

| | Scope | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| M0 · Tooling | JDK 17, SDK platform 34, build-tools 34.0.0, the emulator and the API 28 TV image; the CI size gate changed to report | The current launcher builds and runs as Home on the emulator, and this file's commands are confirmed |
| M1 · Foundation | New Home activity, made Home; the old Home UI, its feature code and the tests that only covered it deleted; design tokens (colours, type, radii, focus); nav bar; screen stack with page, popup and dialog layers; Back rules; focus memory per row and grid; page transition; the three top-bar dropdowns; Settings button | The new launcher is Home on the emulator; every nav item and dropdown works with the D-pad, Back follows the spec's four rules, and pages are placeholders |
| M1b · V1 cleanup | `Config.java` and `config.xml` cut to the keys the new launcher reads, with their dormant helpers; theme-visual tools and tests; the docs (`docs/switches.md`, `docs/sky.md`, `docs/workflows/translation.md`, the module-card spec) and the README's old launcher sections; redraw `docs/card.jpg` and `docs/stats.png`, which still say 25 languages | Nothing in the repo describes or tests the old Home's UI |
| M2 · Home | Greeting, date, clock, weather; the app row with its hold-OK menu; the scrolled state with Inputs, Shortcuts and hourly weather | Home matches the prototype, with real apps, inputs and weather, and works offline |
| M3 · Data layer | Household store; catalogue interface with the mock source; offer rules; image loading and cache | Unit tests cover the store, offers and filters |
| M4 · Movies and TV Shows | Header, list chips, grid, Filters drawer, empty states | Filters update the grid live; both empty states reachable |
| M5 · Title preview | Popup over the page, actions, Overview, Episodes, Where to watch, Cast & crew, More like this; rent/buy dialog; person stub | Every tab and toggle works; Watch opens the service's app |
| M6 · Search | Bar with ghost text, 6×6 keyboard, recents and suggestions, results preview, full results, no matches, typing from a hardware keyboard | Fuzzy matching ported with its tests; focus and Back match the prototype |
| M7 · Pick for me | Setup and results | Reroll, Adjust filters and both buttons on the results bar work |
| M8 · Finish | Music, Launcher settings, All Apps and Weather stubs; docs; the real TV | A run on the TCL BeyondTV with the project lead |

## Toolchain and emulator

Confirmed on Windows 11 in M0 (2026-10-28).

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.OpenJDK.17 --exact   # asks for administrator rights once
# Android command-line tools: commandlinetools-win-*_latest.zip from https://dl.google.com/android/repository/,
# unpacked to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\cmdline-tools\latest. Its sdkmanager now hands over to the new
# `android` CLI, which names packages with / where sdkmanager used ;
$bin = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin"
& "$bin\android.exe" sdk install platform-tools emulator platforms/android-34 build-tools/34.0.0 system-images/android-28/android-tv/x86
# The new CLI can't choose a system image for a virtual device; avdmanager still can. --% keeps the ; intact.
& "$bin\avdmanager.bat" --% create avd -n tv28 -k "system-images;android-28;android-tv;x86" -d tv_1080p
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\emulator\emulator.exe" -avd tv28 -no-snapshot-save -no-boot-anim
```

The emulator runs with WHPX acceleration and boots in about a minute: Android 9 (API 28), 1920×1080. It has
no HDMI or tuner inputs, so the Inputs rows can only be fully checked on the real TV.

Build and test, from `launcher/`:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-17.0.21.21-hotspot'
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon testReleaseUnitTest lintRelease assembleRelease
```

The emulator image's stock launcher (`com.google.android.tvlauncher`) outranks a sideloaded one, so
`set-home-activity` alone doesn't move Home on Android 9. On the emulator, follow the order the install script
uses: start the new launcher, disable the stock one, then set the preference and check where Home resolves.

```powershell
$adb = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe"
& $adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
& $adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.HOME -n com.gathin.tvhome/.MainActivity
& $adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.tvlauncher
& $adb shell cmd package set-home-activity --user 0 com.gathin.tvhome/.MainActivity
& $adb shell cmd package resolve-activity --brief -c android.intent.category.HOME -a android.intent.action.MAIN
```

Take screenshots with `adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/x.png` and then `adb pull`. PowerShell's `>` breaks binary
output, so `adb exec-out screencap -p > x.png` gives an unreadable file.

Testing on the emulator, learned in M1:

- Keys from `adb shell input keyevent` skip the accessibility key filter, so they never reach `HomeKeyService` or
  `InputKeyService` (AGENTS.md: an injected key is not proof). The emulator's console (`adb emu event send`)
  produced no key events either. To see a screen those helpers open, `adb root` (the image allows it) and then
  `adb shell am start -n com.gathin.tvhome/.QuickSettingsActivity`; the helper's own key handling waits for the
  real remote.
- A test `config.json` pushed to `/sdcard/Android/data/com.gathin.tvhome/files/` switches config keys without a
  rebuild, as `tools/theme.sh` does; `am force-stop com.gathin.tvhome` and start Home again to read it. For example
  `{"live_tv_package":"com.lego.android.tvleanback"}` gives the Inputs icon a Live TV row on an emulator with no
  inputs, and `{"settings_key_keycodes":[131],"settings_key_panel":true}` makes F1 the Settings key.
- The Wi-Fi name needs `pm grant com.gathin.tvhome android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, as the install script
  does.

Baseline before any rework code: the current launcher builds in about 90 s with zero lint errors, the release
APK is 509,545 B, and it runs as Home on the emulator. After M1 the release APK is 163,624 B and Home uses about
25 MB (PSS) on the emulator.

The real TV is a TCL BeyondTV on Android TV 9. Read its folders in `examples/` (`tcl-beyondtv` and the ones next
to it) and the TV safety rules in AGENTS.md before touching it. Install only after the project lead says the TV
is free, with `launcher/build-and-install.sh`, which keeps the Home guard.

## Real or mock

Each element in the spec is either wired to a real source or uses mock data, and every mock or fallback has an
entry in [BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md): what V1 does, what the real version needs, and any notes. A PR that adds a
mock adds its entry; a PR that makes one real removes the entry.

## Definition of done

A PR is ready for the project lead when:

- Behaviour matches the prototype (Back, first focus, focus memory, what OK does) and the look matches Figma, with
  any difference listed in the PR and the reason for it.
- Every focusable item has a visible focused state; text and focus stay inside the title-safe area (96 px at the
  sides, 54 px top and bottom); no text below 18 px at 1080p.
- It works from the D-pad alone, from every edge, and Home still works with the network off.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon testReleaseUnitTest lintRelease assembleRelease` passes with zero lint errors, and the
  APK size is in the PR.
- New logic has unit tests, or the PR says why it needs none.
- BACKLOG.md is up to date.
- No secrets or identifiers in code, commits or screenshots.
- Emulator screenshots or a video are in the PR. A real-TV run happens only when the project lead has said the TV
  is free.

## Reference: cleanyourtv-ui

[matheus-caldeira/cleanyourtv-ui](https://github.com/matheus-caldeira/cleanyourtv-ui) (MIT) already does in
plain Java much of what the backlog needs, with no extra libraries. Its `launcher-ui/` has `Tmdb.java` (TMDB with
a disk cache), `Images.java` (memory and disk image cache), `Providers.java` (TMDB services to TV apps),
`DeepLinks.java` (Wikidata ids to title links), `Qr.java` and `TmdbLoginActivity.java` (TMDB sign-in by QR).
Use it as inspiration, not a guide. Any code adapted from it keeps its notice at the top of the file.
