# Themes

The launcher's look is a theme, chosen on the TV in **Launcher settings › Theme**. A theme changes the colours, the
type, the corners, the shading and focus glow, and the picture behind Home; the pages, rows, apps and data are the
same in every theme. The themes are built into the launcher, drawn from the Figma file "CleanTV · Theme explorations"
(`lwShqRaciMpDUDW5dYljNw`), and the [design preview](../design_preview/README.md) wears the same ones.

**Classic** themes keep their look all year. **Seasonal** themes follow the date through ten periods: Snow (January
and February), Thaw (March), Spring rain (April), Bloom (May), Pride (June), Midsummer (July), Late summer (August),
Autumn (September to mid-October, and November), Halloween (mid-October to 2 November) and Christmas (December). A
Seasonal theme's colours and picture are its period's; its shapes and type are its style's. Its picture also follows
the sun: dawn, day, sunset and night, from sunrise and sunset at the Weather place.

| Built-in theme | Look | Home on a TV |
|---|---|---|
| **Midnight** | The default: deep navy over an evening landscape, no glow or shadows, Roboto | <img src="../docs/themes/midnight.jpg" width="320" alt="Midnight theme"> |
| **Daylight** | Light and airy: a misty lake, soft white tiles with a gentle shadow, Figtree | <img src="../docs/themes/daylight.jpg" width="320" alt="Daylight theme"> |
| **OLED Black** | True black for OLED screens, no picture, Manrope | <img src="../docs/themes/oled.jpg" width="320" alt="OLED Black theme"> |
| **High Contrast** | Black and white with a bold yellow focus ring and thicker lines, Atkinson Hyperlegible Next | <img src="../docs/themes/high-contrast.jpg" width="320" alt="High Contrast theme"> |
| **Cinema** | A theatre curtain, sharp corners, a warm gold glow on focus and a soft vignette, DM Serif Display and DM Sans | <img src="../docs/themes/cinema.jpg" width="320" alt="Cinema theme"> |
| **Landscapes** | A new landscape photo every hour (four in turn), Outfit | <img src="../docs/themes/landscapes.jpg" width="320" alt="Landscapes theme"> |
| **Vector art** (Seasonal) | A flat drawing of the season, rounder corners, Baloo 2 and Nunito | <img src="../docs/themes/seasonal-vector.jpg" width="320" alt="Seasonal Vector art theme"> |
| **8-bit** (Seasonal) | A pixel-art scene of the season, square corners and hard offset shadows, Press Start 2P and Pixelify Sans | <img src="../docs/themes/seasonal-8bit.jpg" width="320" alt="Seasonal 8-bit theme"> |

The screenshots are Home on a TCL TV (Android 9) at the end of October, so the Seasonal ones show Halloween.

- **Typeface:** each theme's fonts come from Google Fonts, downloaded once and kept on the TV (Roboto until they
  arrive); Launcher settings › Theme › Typeface can put every theme in the TV's own Roboto instead.
- **Time of day:** Launcher settings › Theme › Time of day keeps a Seasonal picture on the day (Always day) instead of
  following the sun.
- **Pictures:** Midnight's and 8-bit's are in the launcher; the others are downloaded once from
  `theme_assets_url` in `launcher/tv.properties` (by default [`launcher/backdrops/`](../launcher/backdrops/README.md)
  on this repository's `main`) and kept, with the theme's sky gradient while they load or offline.
- **On a slow TV:** Launcher settings › Performance can turn off card shadows, the focus glow, the picture and the
  animated details, or set them all at once with Light mode; a TV with little memory starts with the lighter choices.

## Per-TV settings in a config.json

A folder with a `config.json` pushed to the TV overrides the launcher's built-in
[`config.xml`](../launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml) without a rebuild: the per-TV keys (dock apps, hidden
apps, the Live TV app, inputs, remote keys) in the [Keys](#keys) table. Several [`examples/`](../examples/) folders
carry one. Pushing a folder, or using `tools/theme.sh --reset`, also clears the Performance and Motion choices made on
the TV; the Theme picker's choice and the app picked for Open on start stay.

```bash
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh examples/<your tv>      # push a folder's config.json and restart Home
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/theme.sh --reset                # back to the built-in config.xml
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\theme.ps1 -TvHost 192.168.1.50 examples\<your tv>
```

`tools/manage.py list themes` and `list switches` list them from this file, `show <name>` gives one with its
screenshot, and `manage.py set <switch> <value> --theme <your folder>` writes a key into a folder of your own and
pushes it with `theme.sh`.

## The old launcher's theme folders

> **Frozen.** The folders here were themes for the old launcher: a `config.json` with its look and layout keys, a
> picture and a screenshot. The reworked launcher reads only their per-TV keys, so they no longer change its look;
> they stay as a reference ([docs/rework.md](../docs/rework.md), M1b scope).

| Theme | What it did | Screenshot (old launcher) |
|---|---|---|
| `default/` | The built-in look written out as JSON, as a starting point for your own | [screenshot](default/screenshot.jpg) |
| `aurora/` | A dark aurora wallpaper (teal and violet on navy, darker at the bottom) with a matching background colour | [screenshot](aurora/screenshot.jpg) |
| `dussehra/` | Festive skin for Dussehra (ends 21 Oct 2026): a marigold toran, a faint gold rangoli, a diya for Wi-Fi, a bell for Inputs, a marigold for Settings and a petal shower | [screenshot](dussehra/screenshot.jpg) |
| `glass/` | Dark navy wallpaper with soft teal and violet light, the cinematic top shelf, a frosted-glass dock, icon-only buttons and the focus glow in the app's colour, gliding without overshoot | [screenshot](glass/screenshot.jpg) |
| `ruska/` | A Finnish autumn ("ruska") dusk over a lake: spruce shoreline, birches in autumn colour, a few falling leaves, drawn in code by `make_wallpaper.py`. The app-colour glow stays off the picture so the autumn colours keep their own light; the dock is 70% opaque so the lake shows through, and the focus glows in the app's colour without overshoot | [screenshot](ruska/screenshot.jpg) |
| `scenes/` | 14 dark illustrated landscapes in `wallpapers/`, a new one every hour; drawn from code by upstream's [`tools/scenes_wallpapers.py`](https://github.com/Gathin23/cleanyourtv/blob/main/tools/scenes_wallpapers.py) | [screenshot](scenes/screenshot.jpg) |
| `six-columns/` | Six smaller tiles per row and one grid row visible under the dock | [screenshot](six-columns/screenshot.jpg) |
| `sweden/` | Three photos of Sweden from Wikimedia Commons (the aurora over Abisko, Vasabron at dusk, Skeppsbron in the evening), a new one every hour with its place and photographer under the buttons; six small tiles in a frosted-glass dock, round icon-only buttons, no hero name. The photos are CC BY / CC BY-SA, not MIT: see `sweden/CREDITS.md` | [screenshot](sweden/screenshot.jpg) |

## Keys

Every key is optional; a missing key keeps the value from `config.xml`, an unknown or wrongly typed key
is ignored, and a file that doesn't parse is ignored as a whole, so a theme can never break Home.

The table is the old launcher's full list, kept as a reference. Keys marked *Old launcher only* are ignored by
this launcher (its look comes from the built-in themes); the rest still work.

Each key has (or is waiting for) a screenshot of it on a real TV in [`docs/switches.md`](../docs/switches.md).
A new key needs one there in the same pull request.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `dock_apps` | list of package names | The dock row, in order; missing apps are skipped |
| `fill_dock` | bool | Fill the dock slots `dock_apps` leaves free with the first grid apps (true by default); false leaves them empty |
| `hidden_apps` | list of package names | Never shown as tiles |
| `live_tv_package`, `live_tv_action` | string | The Live TV app and, if it has no leanback entry, the action to start it with |
| `live_tv_input_id` | string | Exact system tuner for the Inputs menu's Live TV row; opens its channel collection. Empty keeps automatic selection. Missing input or unsupported collection falls back to the app's normal launch. [HAAM satellite example](../docs/devices/haam-r4.md) |
| `source_panel_service`, `source_panel_action` | string | The TV's own source panel, for sets with no TvInputManager: a service, or an activity (BYINTEK U4). Without a Live TV app, the Inputs pill opens it directly |
| `source_panel_extra` | `"name=value"` | One int extra sent with the source panel (Coocaa OS: `control_center_command=100`) |
| `coocaa_sources` | bool | Coocaa OS (Skyworth, China): list the sources from `com.skyworth.tv` in the Inputs menu, ahead of the source panel |
| `launch_actions` | list of `"package=action"` | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Tiles that open a screen of the app instead of its start screen; an action that no longer resolves opens the app normally (MagentaTV's guide: `com.telekom.onetv.tv.pl=com.telekom.onetv.tv.pl.action.PROGRAM_GUIDE`) |
| `app_labels` | list of `"package=Name"` | A tile's name instead of the app's own (MagentaTV as `com.telekom.onetv.tv.pl=TV`) |
| `app_banners` | list of `"package=banner_name"` | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* A tile's artwork from a `banner_*` drawable bundled with the launcher (`banner_tv`: magenta with the Live TV glyph) |
| `input_action` | string | Action sent with an HDMI/AV row's channel URI when nothing handles the standard `VIEW` (XGIMI: `com.xgimi.action.hdmiPlayer`). Only a handler-less set gets here; any app that claims the channel MIME type takes the row instead, so check with `query-activities` ([#805](https://github.com/Gathin23/cleanyourtv/issues/805)) |
| `input_uri_scheme` | string | Scheme an HDMI/AV row's passthrough URI is sent with instead of `content://`, with no MIME type (YaOS: `live-tv`, which its source player answers) |
| `input_sources` | list, `config.xml` only | Vendor source numbers for the Inputs menu, `HW<n>=<number>` by the input id's last part; a mapped input opens by sending `input_action` with the number as the int extra `input`, and `HW<n>=-` leaves a port the set doesn't have out of the menu. Xiaomi/Redmi China firmware: [redmi-mitv-mftp0](../examples/redmi-mitv-mftp0/). Not read from a theme |
| `columns` | 1 to 8 | Tiles per row; tiles shrink to fit from 5 up |
| `rows_below_dock` | 0 to 3 | Grid rows left visible under the dock; tiles shrink if the dock, its title and that many rows would not fit the screen height |
| `dock_title` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The focused dock app's name in large type above the dock (`true`); `false` keeps only the glow |
| `dock_row` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The dock as its own row with a band (`true`); `false` makes the dock apps the first tiles of one plain grid |
| `reorder_button` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* A reorder button in the top bar (`false` by default); reordering is always in the Settings button's long-press menu |
| `show_network_pill` | bool | The Wi-Fi/Ethernet pill in the top bar (`true` by default); `false` hides it |
| `top_bar_apps` | list of package names | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Apps shown as round buttons with their own logo in the top bar, left of the network pill; they leave the grid |
| `show_inputs_pill` | bool | The Inputs pill in the top bar, shown when the TV has inputs (`true` by default); `false` hides it, and with `top_menu` it also leaves Inputs out of the gear's menu (streamers with no HDMI input, such as the Chromecast with Google TV); what the remote's Input button does is unchanged |
| `icon_only_buttons` | bool | Wi-Fi and Settings as round icon buttons; Inputs keeps its label (`false` by default) |
| `icon_only_inputs` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The Inputs pill as a round icon button too, its label kept as the TalkBack description (`false` by default). Works with or without `icon_only_buttons` |
| `top_menu` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Inputs, Wi-Fi and Settings folded into one round gear, centred on the header: OK drops a menu with the three plus Reorder apps, hold OK keeps the launcher menu (`false` by default) |
| `launcher_settings_button` | bool | Make the header Settings action open Launcher settings directly with a matching 22dp home icon; also changes the Settings row when `top_menu` is on. Hold OK keeps module-card and ordering tools. The settings page includes Reorder apps and TV settings (`false` by default) |
| `wifi_status_color` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The Wi-Fi pill's icon green while the TV is online, white while it is not (`false` by default) |
| `wifi_status_warnings` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With `wifi_status_color`, the icon orange while connected without internet (a captive portal waiting for its login page) and red while offline, instead of white (`false` by default) |
| `wifi_label_width` | 0 to 300 | With `icon_only_buttons`, keep the network name on the Wi-Fi pill up to this width in dp, cut with an ellipsis; 0 leaves only the icon |
| `library_button` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The app library as a round button in the top bar, beside Settings; needs `app_library`. Closing the library returns to it |
| `always_show_names` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Names under every tile, dimmed until focused, the dock included (its band grows to hold them); `false` by default shows only the focused tile's name |
| `wallpaper_true_color` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Decode wallpapers in 32-bit colour (8 MB at 1080p) instead of RGB_565 (4 MB), which bands dark gradients such as a night sky; for TVs with 2 GB or more (`false` by default) |
| `app_library` | bool | An App library pill after the last Home row: every installed app, add one to Home or take it off (`false` by default). The choices stay on the TV when a theme is pushed or reset; see [docs/app-library.md](../docs/app-library.md) |
| `uniform_tiles` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Each app tile is its icon on a card tinted from that icon, with the name only under the focused tile, instead of the app's own banner (`false` by default) |
| `app_library_selection` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* OK toggles Home checkmarks in the library; checked apps first, both groups alphabetized. Hiding keeps focus on the adjacent next app (previous at the end). Requires `app_library`; `false` preserves the standard open/long-press behavior |
| `library_apps` | list of package names | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Packages pre-seeded into the App library's "added" set at startup (config.xml `library_apps`, or a theme's `config.json`). They show on Home as if the owner had added them in the App library UI, and stay removable there (a removed one stays hidden); empty (off) by default |
| `shamsi_date` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Show the Solar Hijri date above the Gregorian one |
| `lunar_date` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Show the lunisolar date under the Gregorian one, e.g. `LUNAR 13/9 · YEAR OF THE HORSE`, or `13/9 ÂM LỊCH · BÍNH NGỌ` in Vietnamese; a leap month is marked. Off by default |
| `lunar_utc_offset` | 0 to 14 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Hours east of UTC the lunar calendar is computed for: `7` is the Vietnamese calendar, `8` the Chinese one; they differ by a day now and then (and by a month in 1985). Unset: 7 when the TV is in Vietnamese, 8 otherwise |
| `greeting_name` | string | A name after the greeting, e.g. `"Mr. Trịnh"` for GOOD MORNING, MR. TRỊNH; empty for the greeting alone |
| `show_greeting` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The greeting above the clock (`true` by default); `false` hides it |
| `header_white` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The date and the line between the clock and the date in the clock's full white instead of dimmed (`false` by default) |
| `module_cards` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Look for module cards and ask about them (`true`); `false` turns the feature off |
| `reduced_motion` | bool | Calmer motion for weak GPUs: the highlight slides without bouncing and settles within 5 frames, every animation lasts 90 ms or less, names, the top shelf, the glow and the highlight appear instead of fading, and there is no tile entrance (`false` by default) |
| `boot_to_live_tv` | bool | Open the Live TV app (`live_tv_package`) on the first Home after the TV starts, once per boot |
| `open_on_start_choice` | bool | `true` adds an **Open on start** row to Launcher settings: pick an app on the TV, and the first Home after each boot opens it instead (once per boot; `boot_to_live_tv` wins when both are set; an app that is gone or disabled leaves Home on screen). Off by default |
| `first_run_checklist` | bool | First run's checklist (Set up your Home screen) shows by itself once, on the first start of Home after a fresh install, never after an update. On by default; `false` never shows it by itself. `adb shell am start -a com.rmcfad.tv.action.FIRST_RUN -n com.rmcfad.tv/.MainActivity` opens it at any time |
| `light_defaults` | string | Where Launcher settings › Performance starts on this TV: `on` starts at the light end (no card shadows, Motion Reduced, no animated details), `off` with everything the theme draws, `auto` (the default) by Android's low-RAM flag. Choices made on the TV win; a push clears them |
| `focus_overshoot` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The highlight and the focused tile swing past their target before settling (`true` by default); `false` glides straight there with smooth scrolling |
| `vpn_app` | string | App the network pill opens when a VPN is configured; also shows a red "VPN off" badge while no VPN is up |
| `animations` | bool | Basic focus, glass, title and tile entrance motion; true by default |
| `advanced_effects` | bool | Optional lifted tile, icon zoom, smooth ambient colour and app opening effects; false by default |
| `show_home_settings_shortcut` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Keep the optional Default-home tile visible when the TV has a home picker; false by default |
| `show_stats` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* One line under the clock with CPU, free memory and free storage. Off unless set |
| `handle_view_inputs` | bool | Answer the system input switcher (`VIEW_INPUTS`, what the remote's Input button becomes) with the Inputs menu, for sets whose stock launcher was its only handler (Hisense huangshan); `false` by default so a TV with its own input picker never gets a chooser |
| `background_color` | `#RRGGBB` | Colour behind everything; black by default |
| `sky_intensity` | 0 to 100 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Time-of-day backdrop: a dark gradient that follows the clock, 0 hides it (default) |
| `wallpaper` | bool | Show the theme's picture, `wallpaper.jpg` or its `wallpapers/` collection (`true`), or draw neither (`false`) |
| `wallpaper_rotation_minutes` | 0 to 1440 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Rotate images in the theme's `wallpapers/` folder at this interval; 0 keeps the single-image behaviour. A negative or non-numeric value is ignored, and 0 means "no rotation", not "every minute" |
| `wallpaper_order` | `shuffle` or `sequential` | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* How a collection advances. `shuffle` (the default, and what launchers did before this key existed) avoids repeating the current picture; `sequential` walks the folder in filename order and wraps at the end. An unknown value falls back to `shuffle` |
| `wallpaper_dim` | 0 to 90 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Black overlay over wallpaper images, in percent; 0 by default and no shade view at all |
| `dock_opacity` | 30 to 100 | Opacity of the dock's band, in percent, so a wallpaper shows through it; 100 by default (the cinematic shelf keeps its own translucent band). Launcher settings on the TV offers 100, 70, 50 or 30, which wins until the next theme push or Follow theme |
| `wallpaper_captions` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With a rotating collection, the shown picture's name under the top-right buttons, from `wallpapers/captions.txt` (`001.jpg<TAB>Dusk over the peaks`, one per line); a picture without a line shows no name (`false` by default) |
| `wallpaper_moods` | object | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* A rotating collection grouped by time of day: `{"morning": [...], "evening": [...], "night": [...]}` with file names from `wallpapers/`. Morning runs from sunrise to noon, evening until half an hour after sunset, night the rest, with the sun at config.xml's `latitude` and `longitude` (07:00 and 18:30 without them); a missing group rotates through every picture. Unset by default |
| `tile_menu` | bool | Hold OK or press the remote's Menu key on a tile to open a small menu: Move, Remove from Home (with `app_library`) and App info. `false` (the default) keeps holding OK as a shortcut to the app's App info page and leaves Menu unchanged |
| `festival` | string | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Turns on a festive skin: the network pill becomes a diya whose flame follows the connection, Inputs a temple bell, Settings a marigold, and the first Home of the day gets a petal shower. `dussehra` and `diwali` have built-in greetings |
| `festival_until` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Last day the festive skin shows; it switches itself off after that. A malformed date turns it off |
| `greeting` | string | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Replaces the time-of-day greeting while the festive skin is on |
| `accent_color` | `#RRGGBB` | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Colour of the focus glow while the festive skin is on; diya gold if not set |
| `settings_key_keycodes` | list of keycodes | Remote buttons that open Settings, for `HomeKeyService` (TCL Google TV gear: `[83]`) |
| `settings_key_panel` | bool | Those buttons open a small quick settings panel (TV settings, Display, Network, Apps, Launcher settings) instead of the TV's Settings |
| `settings_fallback_components` | list, `config.xml` only | Vendor screens tried in order when nothing usable answers the standard Settings action (Xiaomi China, TCL/FFALCON, and Fire OS, where the real menu lives in its launcher), each as `package/activity`; the first one whose package is installed wins, and when none is, the standard intent is sent anyway and may open nothing. Fire OS answers that intent with a `CTSDummy` stub, which counts as missing so the fallback runs. A package named here also has to be listed in the launcher's `<queries>` (Android 11 package visibility), so a set whose settings app is neither of these needs a build, not a theme push. Not read from a theme |
| `restore_key_services` | bool | After a force stop of the launcher, Home puts the remote's accessibility helpers (`HomeKeyService`, `InputKeyService`) back on the enabled list; needs `RESTORE_KEY_SERVICES=1` at install. Off by default |
| `input_key_keycodes` | list of keycodes | More remote buttons that open the input switcher, for `InputKeyService` (`KEYCODE_TV` and `KEYCODE_TV_INPUT` always do) |
| `app_keys` | list of strings | Remote buttons that open an app, as `"190:com.google.android.youtube.tv"` or `"KEYCODE_BUTTON_3:com.google.android.youtube.tv"`, or by scancode as `"scan:490:com.wbd.hbomax"` for remotes that share one keycode between app buttons (Sony BRAVIA), for `InputKeyService` or `HomeKeyService`. `"input:<input id>"` in place of the package switches to a TV input instead, e.g. `"scan:227:input:com.tcl.tvinput/.passthroughinput.TvPassThroughService/HW1413744640"` for an HDMI port (ids from `dumpsys tv_input`). `"inputs"` in place of the package opens the Inputs menu, for a remote whose source button sends a key Android does not map, e.g. `"scan:365:inputs"` (TCL 65C745). An action word in place of the package runs that action: `back`, `home`, `recents`, `mute`, `sleep` (standby, Android 9 and later), `screensaver`, `settings` or `wifi`, e.g. `"KEYCODE_PROG_YELLOW:mute"`. Prefix an entry with `hold:` to make it the long-press action, e.g. `"hold:190:com.netflix.ninja"`, while the unprefixed entry still opens on a tap |
| `key_filter` | bool | `false` makes the key helpers stop filtering keys while staying enabled. Use it on firmware where any key-filtering accessibility service breaks long-press repeat (TCL Google TV on Android 12): the remote buttons above stop working, and volume repeat comes back |
| `gamepad_passthrough` | bool | `true` makes the key helpers stop filtering keys while a game controller is connected, so games see its buttons (Steam Link with an Xbox controller); the remote buttons above do nothing until it disconnects. Needs `key_filter` on. A voice remote that reports a joystick does not count. Off by default |
| `consume_volume_keys` | bool | `true` makes the key helpers swallow Volume Up/Down and repeat a held one themselves (after 500 ms, every 60 ms). Use it on firmware that applies a volume key both before the helper and when the helper hands it back, so one tap moves two steps (TCL G03 / BeyondTV4, Android 11, #1100). Needs `key_filter` on. Off by default |
| `stock_home_redirect` | string | Stock launcher package; if the firmware turns it back on (XGIMI), its home screen is sent straight back here (`HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1`) |
| `race_calendar` | list of races | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* F1 race-weekend mode: from 12 hours before a weekend's first session until 4 hours after the race starts, a panel under the clock shows the next session with a countdown (or the live one) and the weekend's session times in the TV's time zone. Write it with upstream's `tools/race_calendar.py <theme folder>` (not in this fork), which fetches the season from the free Jolpica API; the launcher itself never goes online |
| `home_idle_clock_minutes` | 0 to 1440 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Minutes Home may sit untouched before it shows the clock screensaver (a thin clock and date drifting over a slow glow, as the system "Clock" screensaver does). Any key returns to Home. It starts only from Home, never over Live TV or an app; 0 is off (default) |
| `clock_wallpaper` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The clock screensaver over Home's wallpaper instead of black with a coloured glow; the clock still moves every minute (`false` by default) |
| `clock_wallpaper_dim` | 0 to 90 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* How dark that wallpaper is behind the clock, in percent (50 by default) |
| `clock_glow` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The clock screensaver's coloured glow (`true` by default); `false` leaves the moving clock on plain black, e.g. for an OLED |
| `glow_style` | string | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Shape of the glow behind the focused app, in its colour: `radial` (default) or `horizon`, the colour washing down from the top edge to black; the cinematic shelf keeps its own |
| `glass_style` | string | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Look of the focus highlight: `glass` (default: a translucent slab with a bright top sheen, a crisp rim and a faint outer glow), `rim` (the crisp rim alone, no sheen, fill or glow, for a quiet focus over a wallpaper) or `halo` (the rim with a lighter outer glow) |
| `cinematic_home` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Cinematic top shelf: the focused dock app's artwork, softened, fills the top of the screen in its colour, with a larger name, "Last opened" (apps opened from Home), dock position dots, a focus glow in the app's colour and a translucent dock band; off by default |
| `cinematic_dots` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With `cinematic_home`, the dock position dots under the app's name (`true` by default); `false` leaves them out |
| `cinematic_white_focus` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With `cinematic_home`, the focus highlight stays white on the dock instead of taking the focused app's colour (`false` by default); `app_glow` still colours every tile |
| `cinematic_scrim` | 0 to 100 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With `cinematic_home`, the strength of the dark scrim behind the shelf's name (`100` by default); lower lets a wallpaper show through |
| `cinematic_art` | 0 to 100 | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With `cinematic_home`, the opacity of the focused app's softened artwork (`50` by default); `0` leaves the wallpaper uncovered |
| `dock_even_padding` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The dock band's padding equals the gap between its tiles on all four sides, as far as the grid's edges leave room (`false` by default) |
| `dock_glass` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The dock band as light frosted glass like the top bar's pills (`false` by default); suits `sky_intensity` or a wallpaper, where the solid band reads as a dark slab |
| `single_row` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* Every app in the dock's row, the dock apps first, scrolling sideways; no grid below (`false` by default; needs `dock_row`) |
| `dock_band_all` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* With `single_row`, the band runs behind every app in the row, not only the dock apps (`false` by default) |
| `ambient_glow` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The glow behind the dock in the focused app's colour (`true` by default); `false` keeps only `background_color` or the wallpaper, e.g. for a calm photo background |
| `app_glow` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The focus highlight glows in the focused app's colour on every tile, as `cinematic_home` does for the dock (`false` by default) |
| `fade_rows` | bool | *Old launcher only; ignored now.* The rows fade out as they scroll up under the clock instead of being cut off at a hard line; the wallpaper or sky shows through. The grid then draws into a hardware layer (about 6 MB of graphics memory at 1080p) (`false` by default) |
| `subscribed_services` | list of service ids | The streaming services the household pays for, so their titles read "Included" in the new launcher: `netflix`, `prime`, `disney`, `max`, `appletvplus`, `hulu`, `youtube`, `appletv`, `googletv`, and the rest config.xml lists (US: `peacock`, `paramountplus`, `tubi`, `rokuchannel`, `fandango`). Empty by default: every subscription service whose TV app is installed, and YouTube. An unknown id is ignored, so `["none"]` means none |
| `region` | string | The country whose services, stores, prices and TMDB lists the new launcher shows: `SE` (the default) or `US`. A region chosen on the TV wins over it |

## Wallpapers

*The old launcher's; the reworked launcher's pictures come with its built-in themes (above).*

`wallpaper.jpg` is drawn full screen behind the launcher, centre-cropped. Keep it dark, 1920×1080 and
under about 300 KB: the text, the hero name and the dock band are designed for black, and a 1 GB TV
decodes the picture into memory on every Home start. Pictures larger than the screen are scaled down to
it; a picture that is still over 4K (about 8.4 million pixels) after it is sampled down to the screen is not shown at all, and the plain colour stays.

For a wallpaper collection, place JPEG, PNG or WebP files in the theme’s `wallpapers/` folder beside `config.json`, then set:

```json
{ "wallpaper": true, "wallpaper_rotation_minutes": 30, "wallpaper_dim": 40, "wallpaper_order": "sequential" }
```

The last displayed picture is remembered on the TV, so a restart or reboot resumes from it rather than
starting over at the first image in `sequential` mode. Missing an interval while the TV is asleep or
unplugged does not replay the missed pictures: Home moves on at most once when it wakes. Replacing the
collection starts playback from the new collection's first picture. A collection with one picture is
shown once and never blanked on a timer. Images are centre-cropped to fill the 16:9 screen; dimming is
drawn as a black overlay above the picture and below the launcher's text.

When you apply a theme, its collection replaces the one already on the TV. Use filenames containing
only letters, digits, underscores, dots and hyphens. Images can come from any source; check that you
have permission to use them. The launcher considers
up to 100 nonempty images, at most 10 MB each, skips unreadable files and keeps the last good background.
An empty collection falls back to `wallpaper.jpg`, or the background colour if no image is available.
`"wallpaper": false` disables both single-image and collection backgrounds.

Selection is random without an immediate repeat when alternatives exist. The current image and its
change time survive app/process restarts. Rotation runs only while Home is visible; on return from
another app, an overdue background changes then. Images are decoded on a worker thread and bounded
to the screen size. There is no download service, Internet permission or computer-side scheduler.
The original system idle screensaver is left unchanged.

On the TV, Launcher settings has a Wallpaper row: pick one picture from the collection (or the theme's
`wallpaper.jpg`), or None. A pick shows that one picture and stops the rotation until you choose Theme
default, press Follow theme, or push a theme again.

## Reduced motion

`"reduced_motion": true` keeps the look but calms the movement and draws far fewer frames: the
highlight slides without bouncing and settles within 5 frames, every animation (tile zoom, dropdowns,
the app library) lasts 90 ms or less, names, the top shelf, the glow and the highlight appear instead of
fading, and there is no tile entrance. Use it on TVs whose GPU cannot keep up; a MediaTek MT5895 on
Android 10 is the known case. The default, `false`, keeps the normal motion.

```json
{ "reduced_motion": true }
```

## Time-of-day backdrop

*The old launcher's; not read by the reworked launcher.*

`"sky_intensity": 60` draws a dark gradient over the wallpaper and behind everything else, that follows the
clock: night blues, a soft blue day, then a warm horizon that peaks at seven in the evening.
The glow near the bottom edge travels from left to right with the sun. The colours stay dark so the
white clock, the hero name and the dock band keep their contrast. It is drawn as one 480×270 bitmap
and redrawn once a minute, never animated, so even a 1 GB TV has nothing to keep up with. `0` keeps
the plain background; the default is off (the reference launcher looks exactly as before).

```json
{ "sky_intensity": 60 }
```

That evening peak is a fixed reference day, sunrise 07:30 and sunset 19:00 on the TV's clock. The
launcher follows the real sun only when `latitude` and `longitude` are set in
`launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml`, which is a build setting a theme cannot carry: see
[docs/sky.md](../docs/sky.md) for the two lines and what still falls back.

## Adding a theme

A new built-in theme starts in the Figma file: a mode in its Theme variable collection. Its colours, corners, lines,
shading and fonts then go into the launcher as a palette and a style in `Themes.java` (with a line in `ThemesTest`,
which checks every theme's text contrast), into the design preview's `src/styles/themes.css`, and a picture, if it has
one, into [`launcher/backdrops/`](../launcher/backdrops/README.md) with its credit. Add a row to the table at the top
with a screenshot of Home on a real TV in `docs/themes/`, a 1280×720 JPEG under 300 KB with nothing that identifies
the household (no account names, Wi-Fi names or cities).

The old launcher's folders took a `config.json`, a `wallpaper.jpg` or `wallpapers/` and a required `screenshot.jpg`
of Home on a real TV (1280×720, 16:9, under 300 KB; `tests/test_themes.py` checks it); the folders above keep that
shape.
