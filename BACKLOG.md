# Backlog

Features the new launcher needs but V1 doesn't have yet: where V1 uses mock data or a fallback, what was left
for V2, and what isn't designed. Each entry says what V1 does, what the real version needs, and any findings
so far. A PR that adds a mock adds its entry here; a PR that makes one real removes it. How this fits the
milestones: [docs/rework.md](docs/rework.md).

## Data and accounts

### Real catalogue
- **Now (V2 Phase 1):** with `tmdb_api_key` in `launcher/tv.properties`, titles, artwork, cast and crew (with
  photos), episodes, More like this, trailers, people and search come from TMDB (`TmdbCatalog`), in English
  (en-US). Movies and TV Shows list the household's lists as before; their titles start as stubs (name and year from
  `MockIds`) and fill in from the disk cache, then the network, two seconds after Home is up, three requests at a
  time. Answers are kept in the app's cache folder (`DiskCache`, 16 MB of JSON, 64 MB of images) for as long as
  cleanyourtv-ui keeps them: search 1 hour, discover 3 hours, a title 12 hours, seasons and people a week; a stale
  copy is used when TMDB can't be reached, so what was seen once shows offline. Images come at the TMDB size nearest
  the box (w300 small cards, w780 library cards, w1280 the preview, w185 portraits) and are decoded at the size
  shown into the 24 MB memory cache (`Art`). Without a token the build falls back to the mock catalogue, which needs
  no network; the 17 bundled JPEGs left the APK (1,612,551 B to 275,607 B) and its cards show the plain placeholder.
- **Mock ids:** the 43 mock titles map to TMDB by `MockIds` (looked up once by name and year, 2026-10-30);
  "marvel-one-shots" has no single TMDB title and drops out. The household's stored ids move to TMDB ids
  (`movie:329865`, `tv:95396`) when read. A TMDB build's ids mean nothing to a token-less build, so switching a TV
  between the two empties My list and the rest until it switches back.
- **Search:** TMDB's `/search/multi` once typing pauses (300 ms, from two letters, an hour's cache), merged with the
  fuzzy matching over every title the TV knows, so "arival" still finds Arrival. Titles without artwork and people
  without a photo are left out of TMDB's answer (it lists many namesakes and stubs). A genre typed in full lists its
  titles, the known ones first, then TMDB's most popular (`/discover`, movies and shows taken in turns, 40 at most);
  an exact genre ("drama") puts them before titles merely named like it.
- **Ratings:** the US certification from TMDB's release dates (movies, the theatrical one first) and content ratings
  (shows), on the US scale the filters use. A title without a US rating shows none and counts as not rated (NR) in
  Pick for me. **Open question:** use Sweden's ratings (Btl, 7, 11, 15) where TMDB has them, and how they map onto
  "Up to PG-13" and "Up to R".
- **Loading, offline and error states:** not designed. Until they are: cards keep the raised placeholder while their
  art loads (or for good offline with nothing cached); a title still loading shows what it has (its meta line and
  the preview's details row leave out what isn't known yet), Cast & crew says "Not loaded yet.", More like this
  is an empty row until it answers, and "Nothing similar found for this title." when TMDB has nothing. Movies and TV
  Shows fill in as details arrive, with the filters judging only what is loaded (a stub has no score yet, so
  "Review 7.0+" hides it). Nothing says the TV is offline. Wanted: designs for loading, offline and failure, in
  Figma first.
- **TMDB attribution:** TMDB's terms (developer.themoviedb.org/docs/faq, checked 2026-10-30) ask for the notice "This
  product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB" in the app's About or Credits section, and for
  one of their approved logos (themoviedb.org/about/logos-attribution), less prominent than the app's own mark. For
  now the notice is a line in the old Launcher settings activity (only in builds with a token) and in the README;
  the logo is not in the launcher yet. Wanted: both on the new Launcher settings page once it is designed.
- **The token is in the APK:** `BuildConfig.TMDB_TOKEN` can be read out of the APK by anyone who has it. A read
  access token can only read TMDB's public data, but it is the account's: keep a token build to yourself, and
  revoke the token on themoviedb.org if an APK leaks.
- **Rate limits:** TMDB has no published quota but caps around 40 requests a second and answers 429 past it. A first
  start fetches about 45 details pages (12 hours' cache), a search one page a pause in typing. A 429 or a failure
  is not retried for a minute (`TmdbCatalog`).
- **Still to do:** paging past TMDB's first 20 search results; TMDB's language following the TV's; the full
  filmography and a person page design (see From M5).

### Streaming availability and prices
- **V1:** mock: which service has a title, "Included", and the rent and buy prices. Still so without a TMDB token
  (the mock catalogue).
- **V2 Phase 2 (real):** with a TMDB token, a title's offers are where TMDB's watch providers (JustWatch data) say it
  streams, is free, or can be rented or bought in Sweden, asked with the title's details (`append_to_response=
  watch/providers`, kept 12 hours like them). Prices come on demand, when a preview opens or a list shows a title
  with something to rent or buy, never while Home is hidden (`PriceBook`): Apple's iTunes lookup by the iTunes ids
  Wikidata keeps (keyless; its search as a fallback), Watchmode and the Streaming Availability API only when their
  key is in `tv.properties` (`watchmode_api_key`, `streaming_availability_api_key`). Answers are kept on disk a
  day and used stale offline; a keyed source has a monthly budget under its free plan (`PriceCachePolicy`). The
  merge (`OfferMerge`) keeps the cheapest price per store, type and quality: "Rent 39 kr", "Rent from 49 kr". A
  store no source prices (SF Anytime, Viaplay's store, Rakuten TV) still shows, as "Rent" or "Buy" without an
  amount, and its dialog only opens the app. Where to watch credits its sources ("Availability: JustWatch · Prices:
  Apple"); Launcher settings has the full notices. Pure parts unit-tested; seen on the emulator (2026-10-30).
- **Mock or missing:** without keys only the Apple TV Store has prices, and only for movies whose iTunes id
  Wikidata has: Apple's search finds no movies since late 2025, and no TV seasons in Sweden. No source prices SF
  Anytime, Viaplay's store or Rakuten. Watchmode answers have no currency and are taken as kronor, untested without
  a key; so are the Streaming Availability shapes (hand-made fixtures). Prices are refreshed once a day, not live.
  Decided by the lead, open with the project lead: which stores to show, whether to get keys, a paid plan.
- **Findings (2026-10-30):** in Sweden TMDB lists rent and buy at Apple TV, Viaplay, Rakuten TV, SF Anytime and
  Amazon Video, and still Blockbuster, which closed and is dropped; no Google Play. Watchmode's TMDB-id lookup costs
  2 credits. Streaming Availability prices only Apple TV and Amazon in Sweden. TMDB's add-on channels ("HBO Max
  Amazon Channel") are dropped.
### Two regions
- **V1:** SE only.
- **Wanted:** search SE and US together, since the household also watches through a VPN, and label each result
  with its region.

### TMDB sign-in and watchlist sync
- **V1:** My list, Seen, Favorites, recent searches and recently viewed are stored on the TV only.
- **Wanted:** sign in to TMDB on the TV and keep My list and the rest in step with the account.
- **Findings:** cleanyourtv-ui signs in with TMDB's v3 flow. The TV shows a QR code (`Qr.java`, its own encoder
  after Project Nayuki's, MIT) for a request token that the person approves on their phone. The session id is
  then kept in the app's settings. Without an account, My list and Seen stay on the TV.

### Household and Friends lists
- **V1:** mock placeholders in the list chips and the grid.
- **V2 Phase 1:** still the mock lists, on the TMDB ids of their titles (`MockIds`, `MockOverlay`), with the mock's
  next episode for the "Up next" badge where the real show has that episode.
- **Wanted:** both come from the project lead's TMDB lists. Which list is which is decided when this is built.

### Household seed
- **V1:** on the first run, My list, Seen, Favorites, recent searches and recently viewed start from the
  prototype's mock seed (`design_preview/src/core/store.ts`): My list holds the catalogue's titles on the mock "My
  list", two titles are seen, one is a favourite, four searches and six titles are recent. After that every change
  is kept on the TV (`Household`, SharedPreferences `household`). With the real catalogue the seed and anything
  stored before are TMDB ids (see Real catalogue).
- **Wanted:** start empty, or from the TMDB account once sign-in exists (see TMDB sign-in and watchlist sync).

### Trailers
- **V1:** Trailer opens YouTube's TV app searching for "name year trailer"; without YouTube it says so.
- **V2 Phase 1:** with the real catalogue, Trailer opens TMDB's trailer for the title in YouTube's TV app (an official
  YouTube trailer first, else any), and falls back to the search while the details load or when TMDB has none. The
  emulator has no YouTube, so only the "not installed" toast was seen; check the video opens on the TV.

### Title deep links
- **V1:** "Watch on …", episode rows and Where to watch open the service's app on its home screen. Still so with the
  mock catalogue.
- **V2 Phase 2 (real):** with a TMDB token, Watch and Where to watch open the title itself where Wikidata knows the
  service's id for it: `WikidataIds` asks query.wikidata.org once per title (SPARQL by the TMDB id, `P4947` movies,
  `P4983` shows, kept a month) for Netflix (`P1874`), Disney+ (`P13902`, `P7595`/`P7596`), Apple TV
  (`P9586`/`P9751`), HBO Max (`P8298`), Prime Video (`P14462`, `P14440`, `P8055`) and SVT Play (`P6817`), and
  `DeepLinks` builds the links (formats after cleanyourtv-ui's `DeepLinks.java`). The link goes as an ACTION_VIEW
  intent limited to the service's package (Netflix with `source=30`); when no installed app takes it, the app opens
  on its home screen as before.
- **Mock or missing:** episodes still open the show. TV4 Play, Viaplay, SkyShowtime and the Swedish stores have no
  Wikidata property, so they open on their home screen. The emulator has none of these apps: whether each TV app
  takes its link is still to be checked on the TV.
### Choosing the household's services
- **V1:** subscribed services come from the installed apps, with an override: `subscribed_services` in
  `config.xml` or a pushed `config.json`, a list of lowercase ids (`["netflix", "prime"]`; an unknown id is
  ignored, so `["none"]` means none). Left empty, every subscription service whose TV app is installed counts,
  and YouTube; the Apple TV app counts as Apple TV+, never as the Apple TV store. Read when Home starts, so an
  app installed later counts after Home restarts.
- **V2 Phase 2:** the same rule over Sweden's services too (`WatchProviders`: Viaplay, SkyShowtime, SVT Play, TV4
  Play, Tele2 Play, Telia Play, Hayu, MUBI and others, with their TV apps); a service that also sells (Viaplay)
  counts as a subscription, a store alone (Amazon Video, SF Anytime, Rakuten TV) never. TV4 Play counts as included
  when installed, even on its free tier. With the real catalogue the names follow current branding: "HBO Max", and
  "Apple TV" for the subscription with the "Apple TV Store" beside it.
- **Wanted:** a screen in Launcher settings to tick the services the household pays for.

### Weather location on the TV
- **V2 (Phase 4):** `latitude`, `longitude` and `temperature_unit` still come from the gitignored build properties
  file, `launcher/tv.properties` (template: `launcher/tv.properties.example`, Stockholm), as the default. Launcher
  settings has two rows over them: **Weather location** searches Open-Meteo's geocoding as the typing pauses (no
  key; only the typed name is sent, in the TV's language) and keeps the chosen place's name, region, country and
  position on the TV; "Use default" goes back to `tv.properties`. **Temperature unit** is Default, °C or °F. Home
  fetches the weather for the new place or unit as soon as it is back in front; the cached answer is kept per
  request, so the old place's weather never shows for the new one. The logic is in `WeatherPlace`,
  `WeatherSettings` and `WeatherPrefs`, unit-tested.
- **Waits for design:** the picker is a plain Android dialog (a text field with the TV's keyboard and a list of
  matches) in the old-style settings screen, until the new Launcher settings page and its pickers are designed
  (see [Launcher settings page](#from-m1)).
- **Findings:** Open-Meteo matches names in the language it is asked in. On an English TV "Göteborg" finds only
  Göteborgnuten (Svalbard) and a park; the city is "Gothenburg". In Swedish both names find it.

### Wi-Fi networks
- **V2 (Phase 4):** the dropdown lists the TV's other saved networks under the header (a lock for a secured one,
  "Saved" on the right), and OK switches to one with a "Switching to …" toast, as the prototype's `wifiMenu` does.
  Other networks and Wi-Fi settings stay the last rows. On Android 10 and later, with Wi-Fi off or on Ethernet,
  there is no list and the dropdown is as before; a switch the TV refuses opens Wi-Fi settings.
  New permission: `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` (normal, granted at install).
- **Findings (Android 9 emulator, targetSdk 34):** `getConfiguredNetworks()` lists the networks saved in the TV's
  settings with `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` alone; without location access the connected network's name is hidden
  (`<unknown ssid>`) but its id is not, so the header names it from the saved list. `enableNetwork(id, true)` needs
  `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` (without it: `SecurityException`); with it, Android logs "does not have permission to update
  configuration" and then "Allowing uid … with insufficient permissions to connect", and connects. The saved
  network itself is not changed. Scan results need location access and location on (`getScanResults()` empty and
  `startScan()` false without it). From Android 10 both calls are refused for apps targeting it.
- **Waits for design:** joining a new network (choosing from a scan and typing a password) from the dropdown;
  Other networks opens Wi-Fi settings for that. A failed switch is not reported back: Android falls back to a
  network it can reach, and the header shows it the next time the dropdown opens.

## Left for V2

From the old launcher; not in V1 by decision.

- Themes and wallpapers pushed as `config.json`.
- The clock screensaver. Until it returns, a remote key mapped to `screensaver` (`app_keys`) starts the TV's own
  screensaver only where the firmware has the system's "start now" shortcut; the launcher's clock fallback went
  with the old Home in M1.
- Module cards and the add-ons in `addons/`.
- The Watch Next row.
- Festivals, the sky and the lunar calendars.
- The old Home's on-screen extras: the idle clock (`home_idle_clock_minutes`), the stats line (`show_stats`), the
  VPN badge on the network pill (`vpn_app` now shows its app and state in the Wi-Fi dropdown instead), the app
  library dialog, reorder mode and dock editing. Their `config.xml` keys went in M1b; the theme keys are described,
  frozen, in `themes/README.md`.

## From M1

- **Launcher settings page:** V1 opens the old `LauncherSettingsActivity`, cut to Animations, Open on start,
  Follow theme, Default Home and TV settings; V2 Phase 4 added Weather location and Temperature unit as plain rows.
  Wanted: the new page in the new UI, with designed pickers; the lead is drafting it in Figma.
- **Network icon state:** the nav shows Wi-Fi, Ethernet or Wi-Fi crossed out when offline. The old pill could also
  tint by state (`wifi_status_color`, `wifi_status_warnings`); not designed for the new nav.
- **README card:** since M1b `tools/gen_tables.py` no longer counts languages, and `docs/card.jpg` and
  `docs/stats.png` show TV models, brands and the launcher's size. Its "after", `docs/new-home.jpg`, is a screenshot
  of the new Home from the TV (2026-10-30). The stat strip still says 1.6 MB: redraw it once the APK size settles
  (V2 Phase 1 brought it to about 0.27 MB).
- **Last opened:** `LastOpened` notes when Home or All Apps last opened each app (on the TV only, no permission).
  Nothing reads it since the old Home's "Last opened" line went in M1. Wanted: a use for it, for example ordering
  All Apps or the Home row by recent use, once that is designed.
- **Cold start and jank:** V1 measured 1.9–2.1 s (TotalTime) against M1's 2.8 s and the old launcher's 2.7 s, but 47 %
  of frames were janky while pressing keys on Home ([docs/rework.md](docs/rework.md#results-2026-10-30-main-at-0212b6a4)).
  Phase 0 looks for the cause; measure again on the TV with `tools/bench.py` ([perf-ab](docs/workflows/perf-ab.md)).

## From M2

- **All Apps:** V1 is a plain working grid styled from the tokens (Back, title and count, six columns of banner
  tiles sorted by name; OK opens, hold-OK adds to or removes from Home, App info). Wanted: a proper design, which
  may add search, hiding apps and sorting (the prototype's stub says "with hide and reorder").
- **Weather page:** OK on the weather strip opens a "Not designed yet" stub. Wanted: the hourly and 7-day forecast.
- **Weather icons:** the prototype has three (sun, moon, cloud), so rain, snow, fog and storms all show the cloud;
  the words under the temperature say which. Wanted: icons for those, in Figma first.
- **Empty app row:** with no favourites installed (or all removed) the row shows one "Add apps" tile that opens All
  Apps. Not designed.
- **Inputs on Home:** the tiles show the input's name only; the dropdown's "Connected" and "No device" states are
  not on them (the design has no room for them). On the emulator only a Live TV row could be checked (a pushed
  `live_tv_package`); the HDMI and AV rows wait for the TV.
- **Tile menu:** Move, Remove from Home and App info, in the dropdowns' panel with no icons, under the tile or over
  it where there is no room below. Not designed (the spec lists hold-OK menus as open).

## From M4

- **Scope line:** "3 imported watchlists" counts the three mock lists, and "All N services" the household's
  subscribed services (`subscribed_services` or the installed apps). Wanted: the real number of imported lists once
  they come from TMDB (see Household and Friends lists).
- **Empty list note:** says to "import a watchlist in Settings", which doesn't exist yet (see First run and setup
  under Not designed yet).
- **Filters and the chosen list** are kept per page while the launcher runs, and go back to the default
  ("Included only · Review 7.0+", All lists) when Home restarts. Not designed: whether they should be stored.
- **Genre options** are TMDB's movie or TV genres in the launcher's words (`GenreMap`: "Sci-fi" for Science
  Fiction, "Sci-Fi & Fantasy" as both); TV Shows still leave out Food, Musical, Western and Horror, as the
  prototype does. With the mock catalogue they are its genres, as in V1.
- **Guide line:** with the real catalogue it reads "Scores from TMDB · Where to watch from JustWatch" (V2 Phase 2;
  Pick for me's results likewise); the mock catalogue keeps "Illustrative services, scores & availability".
- **Long lists:** the grid builds a card for every title at once (16 at most in the lists today). A real list of
  hundreds needs a recycled grid or paging, with the artwork decoded as cards come into view. With the real
  catalogue the grid is built again each time a title in it fills in, a few times while the lists load.

## From M5

- **Watch and episodes open the service's app, not the title:** Watch, an included Where to watch card, an episode
  and Rent or Buy in the dialog all open the service's app on its home screen (`Router.watch`); see Title deep
  links. An episode card opens the show's best offer, not that episode.
- **Rent/buy dialog:** Rent and Buy open the store's app; nothing is paid or recorded in the launcher, and the
  dialog doesn't know whether the rental happened.
- **Person page:** the prototype's stub ("Person · not designed yet"), now with the TMDB photo over the initials and
  up to 30 titles they are best known for (TMDB's combined credits, most voted first, without talk shows, news,
  reality TV and appearances as themselves). Wanted: a design, and the full filmography.
- **Cast portraits:** TMDB's photos over the initials (V2 Phase 1); the prototype shows initials only.
- **Watched episodes:** worked out from the mock next episode (`Title.nextSeason`/`nextEpisode`); nothing records
  what was watched. Mark seen marks the whole title only.
- **More like this:** TMDB's recommendations for the title, else its similar titles, eight at most (V2 Phase 1); the
  prototype's rule (shared genres, kind, score) only with the mock catalogue.

## From M6

- **Search source:** TMDB's search merged with the local matching since V2 Phase 1 (see Real catalogue); with the mock
  catalogue, the local matching alone (`Fuzzy` and `SearchIndex`, ported from the prototype and tested against its
  results).
- **Genre suggestions:** OK searches for the genre's name, as the prototype does, and a genre that matches well
  adds its titles to the results. There is no genre page or genre filter chip.
- **Typing from a keyboard:** a hardware keyboard or a remote with keys types a–z, 0–9, space and `- : ' ’ & . ! ?`
  (the prototype's set) into the bar, on the Search page only. Backspace is Back on every screen, Search included
  (decided 2026-10-29): on the full results it brings the keyboard back with the query kept, with the keyboard
  showing it goes Home, and only the on-screen ⌫ key deletes. Accented letters, the system's on-screen keyboard
  (IME) and voice input are not used.
- **Results preview:** while typing, the preview builds only the first three rows of cards (all it can show); the
  full results build every card. Measured on the emulator: about 15 ms a key press, 30–55 ms to widen "a" (139
  results). Check it on the TV.
- **No-matches screenshot:** `work/proto-shots/search-04-no-matches.png` shows Home, so that state was checked
  against `search.ts` rather than a picture.

## From M7

- **Pick for me's fields:** the six fields and their options are the prototype's fixed lists (three lengths, four
  genre pairs, three scores, three ratings), not built from the catalogue's genres or the household's habits.
  Wanted: options that follow the real catalogue once it lands, and a design for picking any genre.
- **Episode length:** for TV Shows the length field reads the episodes' average runtime (the prototype passes every
  show), and with the real catalogue TMDB's typical episode length while the episodes aren't loaded (they load a
  season at a time, in the title preview). A title whose details haven't arrived yet is not picked.
- **Random, not ranked:** picks are four random matches, as in the prototype; nothing weighs score, recency or what
  the household watches. The choices are not remembered between visits either: each Pick for me starts from the
  prototype's defaults.
- **Open in the service:** the results bar's main button opens an included pick's app on its home screen (see
  Title deep links). A rental or purchase opens the title preview instead, so its rent and buy dialog asks before
  leaving the launcher; the prototype's button opened the preview for every pick.

## From V1 follow-ups

- **Jank on Home's key moves:** the real TV measured 47% janky frames (337 of 712), movement p50 197 ms, response p50
  21 ms. The emulator can't show where that goes: every frame there spends 80–100 ms issuing draw commands,
  about 50 ms even with the backdrop, shades, hero, nav, lower rows, banners and labels all switched off, and
  turning any single one off moved it by less than the noise. The UI thread is not the cost (animation 1 ms, layout
  and recording under 0.2 ms per frame, no layout pass on a focus change). Wanted: a `tools/trace.py` run on the real
  TV (hwui and gfx) to see whether the GPU's fill (backdrop, shade and, when scrolled, the dim layer, each full
  screen) or the number of frames per move (140 ms scale and state fades, the 240 ms row slide) is the cost, then
  the fix.
- **Accessibility in the prototype:** the launcher now reports the current preview tab and nav section as selected
  and reads Pick for me's fields with their value; the prototype has no ARIA roles or states to match.

## Not designed yet

From the spec's open questions ([design_preview/README.md](design_preview/README.md)). Each needs a design before
it is built.

- Offline, loading and error states (the launcher still works offline: it just has no designed state for it; see
  Real catalogue for what shows meanwhile).
- First run and setup: importing watchlists, choosing services.
- Removing a recent search.
- Voice search.
- Progress on started titles.
- Sorting lists.
- The person page beyond its stub.
- The Explore versions of Movies and TV Shows (parked in Figma).
- The Music page (a stub in V1).

## Languages

- **V1:** English only.
- **Wanted:** the launcher's translations and right-to-left layout (the old launcher had 25 languages, with
  Hebrew mirrored).
