/**
 * The Home row apps pane's edits (design_preview/README.md, Launcher settings, The other panes; src/screens/panes/
 * apps.ts): OK on an app on Home picks it up, as Home's hold-OK Move does; ← → move it, OK puts it down, ↓ takes it
 * off Home (one must stay) and Back puts the row back as it was when it was picked up. OK on another app adds it at
 * the end, already picked up; Back then takes it off again. Every change is the row Home shows at once, so the pane
 * saves after each one. Pure Java over {@link AppRow}, unit-tested (HomeRowEditTest); HomeAppsSection draws it.
