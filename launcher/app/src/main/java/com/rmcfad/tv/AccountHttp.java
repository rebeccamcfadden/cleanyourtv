 * The one thing the account code needs from the network (BACKLOG.md, TMDB sign-in and watchlist sync): send a
 * {@link Call} and get its {@link Reply}. Stage 2 binds it to the catalogue's HTTP client; the tests use a fake. A
 * call names which token goes in its Authorization header ({@link Auth}) instead of holding it, so a call can be
 * logged or shown in a test failure without leaking a token. Account calls are never cached on disk: the answers
 * are the household's own lists, and v3 writes carry the session id in the URL.
