/**
 * What Movies and TV Shows keep while they are left (the project lead, 2026-11-01, F2): the filters, the chosen list
 * chip and the sort start cleared each time the TV is turned on, are kept while the household leaves the page and
 * comes back, and are cleared again after an hour away. Each page keeps its own.
 *
 * <p>"Turned on" is the launcher's process starting, which a boot always does, or the screen coming back from standby,
 * which on most TVs keeps the process: {@link LibraryPage} holds one of these in a static field, so it lasts as long as
 * the process and no longer, and calls {@link #turnedOff} when the screen goes off. That also carries a page's choices
 * across the activity being made again (a theme or a setting changing), within the hour. The clock is injected; the
 * page's is {@code SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()}, which counts on through standby. Pure Java, unit-tested.
