/**
 * Launcher settings › Features (F14, the project lead 2026-11-01; design_preview's Features pane): one build, with six
 * features switched on or off at run time. A feature that is off never starts: no page, no network call, no server.
 * Each switch is the household's choice saved on the TV, else this TV's config (config.xml {@code feature_<id>}, or a
 * pushed config.json's {@code "features": {"<id>": false}}, as a family install sets it), else on. A feature that needs
 * another (Phone notes needs TMDB account) is off while that one is. Pure Java, unit-tested (FeaturesTest); FeaturePrefs
 * reads and saves the switches, and {@link #current} is what the launcher was built with.
