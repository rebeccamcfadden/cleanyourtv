 * Reduced or Off, saved on the TV under {@link #KEY}. Older settings had only the Animations switch ("animations")
 * and config.xml's reduced_motion; without a saved Motion they decide it, so a TV keeps what it had. A TV whose
 * config.xml or config.json sets reduced_motion never gets Full (the project lead's decision, 2026-10-31). Pure Java,
 * unit-tested (MotionChoiceTest); MotionPrefs reads and writes it.
 *
 * <p>The launcher has one reduced-motion mode (Ui.reducedMotion()), so Reduced and Off both use it for now; the
 * spec's difference (Reduced keeps the fades) is in BACKLOG.md.
