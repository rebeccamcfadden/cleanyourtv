/**
 * Merges one list as TMDB has it now with the TV's copy and the changes still queued on the TV (BACKLOG.md, TMDB
 * sign-in and watchlist sync). Last writer wins for each title:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A title with no queued change takes TMDB's state (added on the phone: it appears; removed: it goes).</li>
 *   <li>A queued change that TMDB already matches is done and leaves the queue.</li>
 *   <li>A queued change where TMDB still has the base (what the TV last read) is kept, to be sent.</li>
 *   <li>A queued change where TMDB changed too, the other way: TMDB doesn't say when, so its change is taken to have
 *       happened just after the TV last read the list. The TV's change wins when it was made after that read, and
 *       loses (leaves the queue) when it is older, e.g. a change that kept failing while reads succeeded.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Titles keep the TV's order; titles new from TMDB go at the end in TMDB's order. Pure Java, unit-tested
 * (ListMergeTest).
