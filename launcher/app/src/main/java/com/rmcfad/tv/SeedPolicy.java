 * <ul>
 *   <li>On start: lists saved on the TV are kept as they are; with none saved (a fresh install) My list, Seen,
 *       Favorites, recent searches and recently viewed all start empty: no seed. That part is

 *   <li>At a sign-in: the same account as last time carries on (changes made while signed out are still queued and go
 *       up). Any other sign-in, the first on this TV included, takes the account's lists as they are and adds nothing
 *       from the TV: the TV's titles, mock leftovers or the household's own, are replaced.</li>
